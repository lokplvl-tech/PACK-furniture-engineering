# Method Card Template

Copy this file to create a new method card. Replace all `_TBD_` and `DOMAIN.M.XXX` placeholders.

> **2026-07-11 — ADDITIVE CHANGE:** added optional `Forces` and `Bias-Annotation` sections (WP-448 Ф9). Not breaking — both sections are optional; existing cards remain valid without them.

### Inputs

_What does this method require to begin? (Information, prior work products, conditions)_

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| _Input 1_ | _What it is_ | Yes/No |
| _Input 2_ | _What it is_ | Yes/No |

### Outputs (Work Products)

_What does this method produce?_

| Output | Link | Description |

### Key Distinctions

_What conceptual distinctions are essential to performing this method correctly?_

- [DOMAIN.D.XXX](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d-xxx): _Why it matters here_

### Bias-Annotation

_(Optional) What systematic distortion does a practitioner risk when applying this method — and in which direction? Name the bias, not a generic warning._

| Bias | Direction of distortion |
